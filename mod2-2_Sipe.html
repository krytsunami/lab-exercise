    <h1>Sword Art Online [My Favorite Anime]</h1>

    <div>
        <p>It begins in the year 2022 a company created the VR game "Sword Art Online",It was the future to the next games experiencing never before graphics,<br>
		This might look like some normal rpg game but the creator made this as a trap to lock in about 10,000 people in the game,One of the players Kirito (Kazuto)<br>
		tried the beta testing of this game not knowing that he would stay in the game for years,As he goes into the game he meets a newbie player who has little knowledge<br>
		about the game,Klein (Tsuboi) and they became teammates after,they helped each other defeat enemies and farm exp,just as they were both about to log out of the game<br>
		the turn off button was nowhere to be found, they soon thought maybe it was only a bug in the game as it was only in beta testing,Suddenly every player was teleported <br>
		into one hall where the creator announces that they would live their lives in this game forever,they can only leave if they pass hall 100 which was like a tower <br>
		that was full of enemies and defeat the final boss,after they go to the top the game ends,but if they die in the game, they die in real life, everyone was devestated <br>
		about this but Kirito just wasn't about to give up he was now fully competative about this which he has no choice but to only finish this game.</p>
